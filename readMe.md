# Tribute to Monty Python's: The Meaning of Life

This project is a tribute to Monty Python's *The Meaning of Life*.
I created this project to practice incorporating various elements on a page,
such as headers, embedded short videos, gifs, articles, and captions.
My goal is to style it in a way that allows users to glide through the page,
much like the humorous section of a newspaper.
While I'm uncertain about the extent of JavaScript I can implement,
I aim to use reactive buttons to enhance interactivity.
